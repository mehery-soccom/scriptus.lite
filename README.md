# BootNode

BootNode is a lightweight, Spring Boot-inspired Node.js framework that simplifies backend development with decorators, modular routing, and built-in support for dependency injection. It is designed to provide an intuitive structure for building scalable web applications using Express and Babel.

## Features

- **Spring Boot-style Routing**: Use decorators like `@RequestMapping`, `@ResponseBody`, and `@ResponseView` to define routes efficiently.
- **Class-based Controllers**: Organize your endpoints with controller classes similar to Spring Boot.
- **EJS Template Rendering**: Built-in support for EJS views with automatic data binding.
- **Scalable Project Structure**: Inspired by enterprise-level backend frameworks.

## Features TBD
- **Dependency Injection**: Easily inject services and middleware into controllers.
- **Database-Driven Scripting**: Execute scripts dynamically from a database while maintaining Babel decorator support.
- **Built-in Middleware**: Provides session management, authentication, and request validation out of the box.
- **Custom Decorators**: Extend functionality with your own method and class decorators.


## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the Server

### Development Mode
```sh
npm run dev
```
This runs the server with Babel for ES module support and live reload.

### Production Mode
```sh
npm run build
npm start
```
This compiles the source code and runs the optimized server.

## Usage

### Defining a Controller
Create a new controller inside `app/controllers/`.

```javascript
import { Controller, RequestMapping, ResponseBody } from from "@bootloader/core/decorators";

@Controller("/users")
class UserController {
  @RequestMapping("/", "get")
  @ResponseBody
  getUsers({ request }) {
    return [{ id: 1, name: "John Doe" }];
  }
}
```

### Rendering Views
```javascript
import { Controller, RequestMapping, ResponseView } from "@bootloader/core/decorators";

@Controller("/dashboard")
class DashboardController {
  @RequestMapping("/", "get")
  @ResponseView
  renderDashboard({ model }) {
    model.title = "Dashboard";
    return "dashboard"; // Renders views/dashboard.ejs
  }
}
```

## Multi-module Support
Default module is `app`, multiple modules can be added parellel to it and `app.js` can be replicated with few changes as below

```javascript
  loadApp({ 
      name : "custom_app", // folder for application, default : app
      context : "/test/",  // context path for each url in application,default : ""
      app, //Must pass app
      prefix : "/account" // prefix for urls, same as context but at path level,  default : ""
  });
```
